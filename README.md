# Image/Video Codec

This is a porject of codec.(JPEG decoder and MPEG2 decoder)
But now I have only finished the JPEG decoder part.The MPEG2 decoder can parse 
the file and get arguments you want.

### Tech
I use this open source project to work:
* [Qt] 

### Todos

 - Output the JPEG result to screen.
 - Finish MPEG2 part including the decoding process after VLC decode.
 - Optimize JPEG and mpeg2 memory management.
 - Support MPEG2 scalable feature.
 - Write document.
 - ....

### Reference

##### 1.JPEG.
Please check this spec. for more information.This is the official standard(Maybe).
>Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images

And I recommend you some websites for better understanding of JPEG.
